.SH NAME
.PP
tack \- a static site generator for the long run
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tack\f[] [\f[I]ACTION\f[]] [\f[I]SITEDIR\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tack reads website sources, like Mustache HTML templates, Markdown
content markup, and YAML site & page variables, and “tacks them
together” to create a static website that can easily be hosted anywhere.
.PP
The tool is completely self\-contained and has no runtime dependencies.
This ensures that updates to the websites you are creating now are still
easily possible do a few years down the road.
.SH ACTIONS
.TP
.B \f[B]tack\f[]
Tack the site together into the folder \f[C]output\f[].
This is the default action, if no verb is specified.

.TP
.B \f[B]serve\f[]
Tack the site together and start a web server on port \f[C]8080\f[]

re\-tacked and reflected in the served site automatically.

.SH SITE DIRECTORY
.PP
The optional \f[I]SITEDIR\f[] arguments refers to a directory that
contains the sources of the website project that should be built by
tack.

If this argument is not specified, tack uses the current working
directory.
.PP
A valid \f[I]SITEDIR\f[] contains:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]content\f[] directory with at least a single metadata
(\f[C]*.yaml\f[]) or markup (\f[C]*.md\f[]) file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]templates\f[] subdirectory with at least a single template file
(\f[C]*.mustache\f[])
.IP \[bu] 2
Optionally: a \f[C]public\f[] subdirectory with static files
.IP \[bu] 2
Optionally: a \f[C]site.yaml\f[] metadata file to define some site
variables
.SH EXIT STATUS
