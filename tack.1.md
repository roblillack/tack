# NAME

tack - a static site generator for the long run

# SYNOPSIS

**tack** [*ACTION*] [*SITEDIR*]

# DESCRIPTION

Tack reads website sources, like Mustache HTML templates, Markdown content markup, and YAML site & page variables, and “tacks them together” to create a static website that can easily be hosted anywhere.

The tool is completely self-contained and has no runtime dependencies. This ensures that updates to the websites you are creating now are still easily possible do a few years down the road.

# ACTIONS

**tack**
: Tack the site together into the folder `output`. This is the default action, if no verb is specified.

**serve**
: Tack the site together and start a web server on port `8080` which can be used to get a live preview of the tacked website. Changes to the source files (content, templates, assest, ...) are re-tacked and reflected in the served site automatically.

**help**
: Display a friendly help message.

# SITE DIRECTORY

The optional _SITEDIR_ arguments refers to a directory that contains the sources
of the website project that should be built by tack.

If this argument is not specified, tack uses the current working directory.

A valid _SITEDIR_ contains:

- `content` directory with at least a single metadata (`*.yaml`) or markup (`*.md`) file
- `templates` subdirectory with at least a single template file (`*.mustache`)
- Optionally: a `public` subdirectory with static files
- Optionally: a `site.yaml` metadata file to define some site variables

# PAGE VARIABLES

For each rendered page, a set of variables will be available to fill into
the chosen template. These variables are read from the page's metadata files.

Next to the user-specified variables, these per-page ones are automatically generated by tack:

`permalink`
: An absolute link to the referenced page.

`slug`
: Last part of the directory name, stripped of any enumeration prefixes.

`name`
: A titlecased version of slug.

`current`
: Boolean to signify if the referenced page is the one currently being rendered (useful to build active elements in navigation menus).

`first`
: (Only if this page is being iterated over as part of a list) Boolean to signify if the referenced page is the first one of the list.

`last`
: (Only if this page is being iterated over as part of a list) Boolean to signify if the referenced page is the first one of the list.

# RENDERING CONTEXT

Additionally to the page variables listed above, when rendering a page, these variables are availble to the template, too:

`parent`
: An object detailing the parent page (giving the variables listed above), if the current page is not a top-level one.

`siblings`
: List of all sibling pages.

`children`
: List of all child pages.

`posts`
: List of all child pages whose directory name starts with `yyyy-mm-dd`.

`ancestors`
: List of all ancestor pages.

`navigation`
: List of all toplevel pages to allow for building navigation menus.

`menu`
: List of all pages on the same level (siblings + current page) to allow for building navigation menus.

# EXIT STATUS

Tack returns a non-zero exit code if tacking the website was not successful due to being unable to read or process any of the input files or if the `output` directory cannot be written to.
