# NAME

tack - a static site generator for the long run

# SYNOPSIS

**tack** [-d] [-s] [*ACTION*] [*SITEDIR*]

# DESCRIPTION

Tack reads website sources, like Mustache HTML templates, Markdown content markup, and YAML site & page variables, and “tacks them together” to create a static website that can easily be hosted anywhere.

The tool is completely self-contained and has no runtime dependencies. This ensures that updates to the websites you are creating now are still easily possible do a few years down the road.

# ACTIONS

**tack**
: Tack the site together into the folder `output`. This is the default action, if no verb is specified.

**serve**
: Tack the site together and start a web server on port `8080` which can be used to get a live preview of the tacked website. Changes to the source files (content, templates, assest, ...) are re-tacked and reflected in the served site automatically.

**help**
: Display a friendly help message.

# OPTIONAL FLAGS

**-d**
: Debug mode. Enabling this function will output more information while tacking pages to ease debugging.

**-s**
: Strict mode. If enabled, tack will quit with an error if an undefined page variable is referenced from any of the templates.

# SITE DIRECTORY

The optional _SITEDIR_ argument refers to a directory that contains the sources
of the website project that should be built by tack.

If this argument is not specified, tack uses the current working directory.

A valid _SITEDIR_ contains:

- `content` directory with at least a single metadata (`*.yaml`) or markup (`*.md`) file
- `templates` subdirectory with at least a single template file (`*.mustache`)
- Optionally: a `public` subdirectory with static files
- Optionally: a `site.yaml` metadata file to define some site variables

# PAGE TYPES

A page is added to the site by creating a directory somewhere below `content/`. This page directory needs to contain at least a single metadata or markup file. Based on the directory name, tack differentiates between three types of pages:

Floating pages
: A page which is not part of the navigation structure of the site. So, if you don't see a need for automatically created menus or you want to exclude individual pages from the menu, use floating pages. Pages are made floating by naming their directory without an enumeration or date prefix.

Ordered pages
: A page that will show up in the **menu**, **navigation**, **siblings** variables so it can be iterated over. The order of pages on the same level is determined by the position given as part of the directory name, ie. _001-about-us_, or _2.products_

Posts
: A post is simply a page directory with a name prefixed with a date in the `yyyy-mm-dd` form. All posts contained in certain page are accessible using the **posts** list of their parent page. Posts will not show up in the **menu**, **navigation**, or **siblings** variables. Example page names are: _2012-08-25.first-release_ and _2021-06-06-tack-version-one_.

Additinally, tack might automatically create “tag pages” as children of a floating or ordered page which is configured to be the “tag index”. See TAGGING POSTS below.

# TEMPLATES

All `*.mustache` (or, optionally, `*.stache` or `*.mu`) files below _SITEDIR_/templates can be used to create HTML page output by filling them with page content. All templates are expected to be written in the Mustache template language.

The default template used to generate a page is called _default_. To use a different template, you can choose to:

- Create a metadata file in the page directory.

  The basename of said file will be regarded as the template name. If, for example, a metadata file like _SITEDIR_/content/about-us/simple.yaml exists, the page /about-us will be rendered using the template from _SITEDIR_/templates/simple.mustache

- Specify a `template` variable as part of the YAML frontmatter in any of the pages' markup files.

  If, for example, the markup file _SITEDIR_/content/about-us/body.md contains frontmatter like this:

  ```
  ---
  template: simple
  ---

  # This is the actual Markdown content
  ```

  The same template from _SITEDIR_/templates/simple.mustache would be used.

# PAGE VARIABLES

For each rendered page, a set of variables will be available to fill into
the chosen template. These variables are read from the page's metadata files.

Next to the user-specified variables, these per-page ones are automatically generated by tack:

`permalink`
: An absolute link to the referenced page.

`slug`
: Last part of the directory name, stripped of any enumeration prefixes.

`name`
: A titlecased version of slug. This page variable can be overwritten using a YAML metadata file or YAML frontmatter.

`current`
: Boolean to signify if the referenced page is the one currently being rendered (useful to build active elements in navigation menus).

`date`
: (Only if this page is a post) Publishing date of the current page in the form `yyyy-mm-dd`.

`first`
: (Only if this page is being iterated over as part of a list) Boolean to signify if the referenced page is the first one of the list.

`last`
: (Only if this page is being iterated over as part of a list) Boolean to signify if the referenced page is the first one of the list.

# RENDERING CONTEXT

Additionally to the page variables listed above, when rendering a page, these variables are availble to the template, too:

`parent`
: An object detailing the parent page (giving the variables listed above), if the current page is not a top-level one.

`siblings`
: List of all ordered pages which are a sibling of the current one.

`children`
: List of all child pages.

`posts`
: List of post pages which are either a child a sibling. Only available to floating and ordered pages.

`ancestors`
: List of all ancestor pages.

`navigation`
: List of all toplevel ordered pages to allow for building navigation menus.

`menu`
: List of all ordered pages on the same level (siblings + current page) to allow for building navigation menus.

`tags`
: If the current page is the tag index page (see TAGGING POSTS below), this list will contain an object for all tags used throughout the site. If the current page is a post, the list will contain a tag object for each tag specified in the page's settings. Each tag object will contain a `permalink` to the respective tag page, the `name` of the tag, the `slug` of the tag, and a `count` how often this tag is used.

`count`
: If the current page is a tag page, this variable will contain the number of posts that reference this tag. See TAGGING POSTS below.

# PAGE SETTINGS

Next to specifying page variables, you can modify the behaviour of tack by setting one of the following variables as part of a pages' metadata or YAML frontmatter:

`name`
: Overrides the name of the page which is usually derived automatically from the directory name.

`posts_limit`
: For ordered or floating pages, this setting can be used to specify the number of `posts` to provide in the rendering context. By default, all posts would be listed.

`tags`
: If the page is a post, you can specify a list of tags to assign to this page here. If the page is not a post, setting this variable to `true` will make this page the tag index (see TAGGING POSTS below).

`template`
: Sets the template to use which is usually derived automatically from the metadata filename. By specifying the template using this setting, you do not need to provide a metadata file for pages at all.

`template_tags`
: For the tag index page (see TAGGING POSTS below), this setting allows specifying a different template to be used for (auto-generated) tag pages. By default, the template of the tag index page would be used instead.

# TAGGING POSTS

Tack includes a functionality to add an arbitrary number of categories, or “tags,” to posts and allows automatically generating an index of all the tags used throughout the whole site.

To use tagging,

1. Add a `tags` page setting to the the posts, ie.

   ```
   ---
   tags: ["cars", "diy"]
   ---

   # How I repaired my Fiat 500 myself
   ```

   for a post talking about do-it-yourself car repairs.

2. Designate one page to be the tag index, by specifying this page setting: _tags: true_ if the pages' metadata file or YAML frontmatter. Optionally, specify a `template_tags` page setting set the template to be used for the tag pages.

3. Start using the `tags` page variable in your post and tag index templates to list the used tags and link to the individual tag pages. In the tag page templates, use the `posts` variable to link back to the posts using these tags.

   Example, tag index:

   ```
   {{#tags}}
   <li>
     <a href="{{permalink}}">{{name}}</a>: {{count}}
   </li>
   {{/tags}}
   ```

# EXIT STATUS

Tack returns a non-zero exit code if tacking the website was not successful due to being unable to read or process any of the input files or if the _output_ directory cannot be written to.
